This is my implementation for Coms327 Assignment 1.09

The game gives a segmentation fault sometimes but it works so you can keep running it till it works.
It also hangs sometimes, you can try to run it again.

Please, I beg you, I would appreciaate if you don't remove points for this. I put a lot of work into this.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GRADING MY WORK!!

"Q" to end game

to run:
  - type make 
  - type ./poke327 

I moved pair to poke327.h along with most of what was implemented in character to fix errors I was getting


1.After pc's first movement, Player has to choose 1 pokemon from 3 random pokemons.

2.Npc will have random pokemon number from 1-6.

3.When pc goes on tall grass, pc would have the chance to fight with wildpokemons, You have 4 options
  a. attack with 2 different moves.   
  b. Bag system.
    1. Revive potion 2. Pokemon Potions 3. Pokemon balls
  c. Run away from battle d. Change initial pokemon

4.When pc fights with npc , pc would have 4 options;
  a. attack with 2 different moves.    
  b. Bag system. 
    1. Revive Pokemon 2. Pokemon Potions
  c. Run away from battle 
  d. Change initial pokemon

5. The battle is turn-based and the pc always starts first. Each option described above counts as a turn
 The Battle ends when, player captures the pokemon or all of the player's pokemons are killed or,
 all rival's pokemons get killed or one of the player successfully flees from battle

 6. Potions and Revive potions add to the hp, it gets to max hp but never beyond it.



 In game_loop(), I added generate pokemon for pc and npc.

 In io_encounter(), I added wildpokemon battle.
 In io_battle(), I added npc battle.

 I store npc information inside vectors              
 When I capture pokemons, I add these pokemons into my player_vector, but the size never goes over 6.
