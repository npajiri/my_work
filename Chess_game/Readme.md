This is my turn-based chess game. 

run make to compile and then ./temp to run the game
make clean to remove generated files

How to play
- Click on a piece to higlight the postions on the board it can move to.
- Click on any highlighted position, denoted by '@' or 'X', to move your piece there.
- Player 1 starts the game
- There is no move check or ai system so It has to be played by two human users
- Once the king(K) is taken out, Game ends


I had a lot of fun making this. Hope you enjoy!!
